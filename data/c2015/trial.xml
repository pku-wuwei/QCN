The letter must be addressed to the Qatar Distribution Company, be stamped and signed by an authorised person within the company, and include the following information:

The applicants position within their company
The applicants basic salary. The word basic must be used. To get a permit a minimum salary is needed (4,000 riyals or 1,100 US dollars)
Whether the applicant receives an accommodation entitlement or has free accommodation
Whether the applicant is married
When applying for a permit an individual must fill in an application form, pay a returnable deposit and state their religion

If your company doesnt issue to whom it may concern salary certificate.  Give your  QID to your wife an let your wife apply for liquor permit for sure they will give her 800 Qrs only as limit but of course she needs to get salary certificate from her company.

 	  <Body> Hello Guys,

I want to get the liquor permit for my wife and she has total salary of 4500 QAR where in the breakup Basic Salary is 1800 QAR. So is she eligible for the drink permit?

We will get the Salary Certificate from her employer but if she does not get the letter addressing QDC regarding my drink permit so my letter being her sponsor with my QID should also suffice?

800 QAR in the post stated is per month limit she will be getting in this case?</Body>

 	  <Body> I think you will have a hard time finding the tailor shop that I asked to make the scrubsuit. If you are near Doha Zoo then its just a couple of blocks away from that place. Its in Al Fereej, Murra - the name of the shop is MURRA LADY TAILOR, the color of the signboard is Purple. Just bring your old scrubs or just a copy then they will make it for you. You can also try to ask any tailor shop that you can see and there are a lot of tailors here in Qatar.</Body>

 	  <Body> Rojek... GOOD LUCK!

Rent in Doha is very expensive. The nicer the place, the more expensive it is. Ive been here since July 2012 and I can tell you, Im still looking! I currently live in AlWakrah on temporary rent because it was the cleanest and on budget that I could find, plus its not a bad drive to my office in Doha.

I would recommend you either find something right outside Doha or get a nice two bedroom and find a roommate. It all boils down to your budget and needs.

Do share what you find! =)</Body>

 	  <Body> 1. Go to the immigration and tell them your application rejected,
2. then they will give you meeting date may be after 3 months.(if you lucky u will get fast) 
3. in the meeting they will ask few question and tell you to check after 3 days(may be you not allowed to ask the reason of the rejection)
4. If you lucky you will get the family visa.
5. After 3 days also its saying rejected you have to go again there. In that time they will say apply after one year.
This is my own experience. I went there 3 times to know the reason of the rejection. they reply  Yalla go come after one year  
specially if you are English speaking. 

They failed to put even  English speaking workers in the main immigration  . 

I know this will not happen to all.  </Body>

 	  <Body> I definitely recommend PEARL SCHOOL, Indian School in Al Thumama area which is near Old Airport.

Very good teachers and Principal.
Our family friends have their daughter studying there and they are extremely happy with the progress and development of the child. Very neat and good class rooms with interesting teaching methods. Our son, we are admitting him this September 2013 when the school reopens after Summer vacation.

Their website is www.pearlschool.sch.qa and phone number is 44442555</Body>

 	  <Body> No  that is far and above what others are paying.
The top rate for a live-in is 1500QR a month with 1 12 days off a week.   Anything above that and you are getting scammed.

It does cost more in the long run for a live-out, so determine carefully exactly how often you think you will need the services.  In most cases it is cheaper to get a live-in.  However then you have to supervise more and put up with sponsorship etc.

For example, I have a part-time cleaner who comes 2 mornings a week.   I pay her 150QR each time (30QR an hour--she is great so I pay more---plus taxi fee).  So each month I pay her about 1200QR  for part time.  I could have full-time for almost that amount. But I dont want to deal with sponsoring anyone, or have a stranger live in my house.  Plus I am a firm believer in teaching my children to work and dont want someone picking up after them.   So for me, I would rather pay more for a part-time cleaner.   

It all depends on your family situation and what your needs are. </Body>

 	  <Body> It's wrong approach to launching a business. Ask yourself first: WHAT do I know ? and What can I do?  You are not going to start something that you have no idea about, right?? 
Second, if you don't know how to launch a business, it means you are NOT a businessman, not by your education, not by your experience, not by your talentinstinct.
My advice: forget about it!
Unless you are only an investor and willing to hire the entire staff of highly educated specialists. 
Then your question should look like: where better to invest my money?

A friend of mine who has a second wife, could bring the second one on a family visit visa, which can be extended for 6 months, he didnt have a civil marriage certificate, only a certificate from an Islamic Center in Europe.  she can only stay for six months, and leave the country and then you apply again, and again...

Please dont choose TEK kindergarten.

 I tried to enroll my kids to TEK kindergarten but then i found out that most of the teachers are NOT teachers. they do not hold a teaching degree nor are sponsor by the school.
I dont know if this happening in everyplace here in Doha?
It is really disppointing to know our kids are going to a kindergarten which has not qualified personel and we trust them with our kids.
Who will be reponsible if something happens?
I send a letter to SEC (Supreme Education Council) but they havent reply.
money is not an issue when we are talking about our kids education, but what education if they are with people we dont know who they are, where ther are coming from.

	  <Subject> TEK - GREAT NURSERY AND KINDERGARTEN </Subject> 
 	  <Body> Firstly I am shocked how a person can be so negative about a nursery and a Kindergarten especially when their children did not go there. My daughter will be four in June and sadly we will be leaving Doha Qatar. My daughter started there in September 2009 and she was in the nursery at TEK then moved into Preschool. When my daughter started at the school the nursery and Kindergarten were in the same premises but since January 2011 they are in seperate premises but are very close to each other and are both well decorated and equipped buildings.
My daughter has loved the nursery and preschool and has had a great time with all the teachers at the nursery and pre school, each morning she is happy to go and she will miss the place.
As a parent I have seen how my baby girl has changed to a little girl and has learnt so much from being at the nursery and kindergarten. It is a great nursery and kindergarten and from my experience it is a perfect place to send a young child. Please do not listern to someone who has not sent their children there, it is friendly and not to large so little children feel safe. </Body>

 	  <Body> Here is my 2Cent..
Qatar: Good to earn
Dubai: Good to spend.

Dubai has a sophisticated crowd compared to Qatar. (My personal observation)
Peeps there know how to dress up. (Doesnt mean people here suck in that category, You just dont find (or maybe rarely) guys wearing jean with different colors on either side OR wannabe Nelly, Snoop Dogg, Eminem...
Dubai doesnt have days such as Family Day in Malls, everyone is equal and when I say everyone..I mean it!

But the best part is....Dubais general mind set is at least 2 decades ahead of Qatar. 

Qatar has a vision, rapid growth (for the better or worse),and a will to succeed in whatever.</Body>

 	  <Body> do the following.

1) start -&amp;gt; run &amp;gt; cmd
2) ipconfig release (in the command prompt window).
3) ipconfig renew.

 this should take care of the problem.</Body>

 	  <Body> Try to restart the wireless router. If the problem stays the same, then it looks like same STATIC IP was set manually on the laptop and another computer or network printer, etc.

Follow the steps in the link below, to see how you can switch between static-dynamic IP.

You can come back at any visa you want ...

Unless you had the Medical test or Finger print Which means you can come back to Qatar but you need NOC its easy to achieve from the previous company as long as you were out of the country legally and not band ...

Good luck !</Body>

to begin with, no one can stop you from looking for another job regardless of your NOC status. the problem is one may not be able to obtain NOC after getting a new job.thus you can always apply for a new job. secondly, NOC applies to those under the companys sponsorship. Thirdly, as i said i do not wish my company finding out that i am FISHING for a new job (fishing being operative word here). especially not them finding out from a third party
i think you shall read ones post better and know your facts before jumping to writing comments such one you posted</Body>

  <Short_Question> Gardening in Qatar? </Short_Question> 
  <Full_Question> Hello,

This may sound strange but is gardening in Qatar possible? Or is the climate too hot? I love to garden. I have some tomatoes, peppers and herbs right now in pots in my terrace. Wondering if I could possibly grow anything in pots there? Thanks </Full_Question>

 	  <Body>Yes, it is possible. But it is a hit and miss thing. right now it is easy, as it is not so hot, later on you need to water twice a day and need to keep your plants in the shade.
The plants you see around Doha are obviously those you may be able to keep alive here.
Also, the soil here is extremely poor, you need to fertilize accordingly.</Body>

 	  <Body>No. 
Initially he will be given 1 month visa. Once hes here, he should take medical examination before 30 days and then you must apply for his visa extension before 30 days. Most probably they will extend for another 2 months (total of 3months now). Then you need to seek further extension, which most probably will get rejected. You can try talking to the captain there, and may approve for another 3 months. The max is 6 months.</Body>

the question may seem silly to you but its important to me.
Rules keep changing here, so rather be safe than sorry.

 	  <Body>if you are allowed by the labor department to accompany your family in the country,i.e you have permission to bring your wife,you can request the transfer from immigration at the cost of 500QR+ Fees.

This is clearly showing in Immigration office in Garafa in the list of fees, you can ask any of the immigration member of staff and he will tell you.

However, if you are unable to bring your family under the labors law,you are adviced to extend her vsist visa before its due,simply the penalty is big and to my knoweledge around 200 QRDay or even more </Body>

  <Full_Question> When I was in the university, one of my professors told our class that Life begins at forty.

She said that when we reached the age of forty, we should already accomplish or attain most of our dreams and ambitions.

In a way she is right.

 	  <Body>I am a citizen, and my wife was denied twice for a tourist visa (not here in Qatar). If you can show that you can support yourself, have a good reason to want to visit, and show that you have ties, obligations, and good reasons why you will return form your visit. They will issue a visa, but it will be upto the officer at the window. I do not think the NOC is even one of the requirements, that is a Qatar thing. Here is the link...

	  <Subject> crowneprince </Subject> 
 	  <Body>your loan wouldnt matter or affect your application. what will matter is that you are able to:

- prove that you have a stable job and earning good salary here. 7 years working in one company is a plus factor (i was granted after 6 years working here in one company and a number of attempts :)

- show them a salary certificate (one of the major requirements as they will base their decision there)

- show a letter from your company allowing you to travel and vouching for the number of years working with them.

- convince them that your travel is short time only, meaning 1 to 2 weeks, not more or else they might become suspicious.

- be specific and mention the places you wish to visit (e.g. Disney World, Disneyland... well thats true, i thought it was just joke before), and not just say visit relatives and friends... and never ever tell that you have a first degree relative who is a citizen there, even if you have, esp. if you are single and young ;)

- be prepared and give your best shot in answering this question as this will truly help a lot to get a positive result:  what is the nature of your work? answer confidently and show them that your work here is very important to you and that you have no plans of abandoning it.

- pray a lot to get that visa :)

take my advise, coz i just did a few months back and i got more than what i have asked for :)

 	  <Body>Interesting to know the 1st answer abt the new law.

Its mentioned behind the invoice that the items can be exchanged within 15 days in case of manufacturing defect. Since u dont hv manufacturing defect, i think on paper u cannot.

If box is not opened yet.
   Can be easily exchanged.
Else if box is opened but not torned
   Request can be made


Leaving papers aside, practically seeing i think should be exchanged. Good luck.</Body>

 	  <Body>prices may be going up . but thats for the gold . profits depend on sales ... its a very competitive market my friend ... specially here in doha . you still have enough time to research the market and know the scene before u take a venture ..

 	  <Body>If the company is being registered in his name with a Qatari sponser the sponser will not give him Exit Permit as most people dnt come back in such cases.

But better check with Legal Advisor to get expert Legal advise who can help you ,as my  cousin brother who had a similar sitution was not be allowed to leave doha till the case was closed.</Body>

 	  <Body>Sure he can leave the country unless he was notified by the court that he can not exit....If there is such a ban on him the court will inform him....and this if the cased filed in court directly.

But..If the case was filed from the capital police or any police dept ...then he will be blocked automatically.

unfortunately there is none here as of now...it was there earlier but closed for few silly reasons....

Iam sure well soon have a proper temple here in doha as Qatar will have to be open to all religions atleast after winning the world cup 2022 BID.

So dont worry...god is always there with us wherever we are.....
