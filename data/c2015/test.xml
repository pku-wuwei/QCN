	<QBody>Hi folks,

I am going to inspect my son's daycare tomorrow in regards to fire safety practices that are (or are not) employed on site. I want to know what the law states as what are minimum requirements, such as a sprinkler system, fire drills and fire exits.

I have had a look through MOI and defense websites, but can't seem to find what I'm looking for. Any advice on this would be much appreciated.

		<CBody>No, it's not a joke, habibi! If you are talking about the kitchen in your house you just have a self-contained smoke detector, not a sprinkler system. A white plastic round object? There is a test button. There may also be a little green light.  If you have a nozzle leading to a pipe that might be a sprinkler system. Sprinkler systems are heat-activated, not smoke sensitive. So don't worry about pushing a button on a white plastic box. It's not hard-wired into the emergency response system. It's just there to wake you up and get you out of the house in case of smoke.

		<CBody>In most buildings these are not smoke detectors (smoke being the primary cause of death in fire situations) they are heat detectors and are therefore mostly useless.

Most people I know who are interested/cognizant of real fire safety have brought smoke detectors from their home countries and installed them in their homes/flats.

Heat detectors are of little to no use - especially if you are asleep when the fire starts.

Smoke detectors are easy to test, just burn a piece of toast in the same or nearby room.  The smoke will set it off.</CBody>

Installation of fire alarm system requires routine preventive maintenance and calibration of detection devices; usually done by qualified technicians.</CBody>

Some good points here though. Raven, I agree, now is the time is for grieving and mourning. However, I still have to drop my toddler off tomorrow at a daycare that may or may not be unsafe. My kids are my first priority and I will do what I have to do as soon as I can, not in the coming weeks. Drsam. Don't be scared of your smoke alarm. It won't bite.......very hard. Good point about the A/C Aijaz, our electricity is dodgy anyway. Lights blow out every day, come on and off on their own accord.</CBody>

	<Comment CID="Q2911_C13" CUSERID="U225" CGOLD="?">
		<CSubject>sprinklers &amp; alarms</CSubject>
		<CBody>for sprinkler systems, I would suggest a joint drill by the house owners and the occupants, and in the case of a school or day care center, it is best decided with cooperation between the parents and the school authorities. 

The test is simple, a hydrotest is all that is required to check the pressure and the coverage area of each sprinkler. 
Refer to this link for your understanding, (note: this is not reality, its just basics)

http://www.archtoolbox.com/materials-systems/fire-supression/83-sprinklerspacing.html

so, from this link, we can say, the distance between the sprinkler heads A &amp; B can be determined by the area covered by distance A (distance must have a minimum over lapse)

and for the fire alarms, usually, a light should be blinking on the FAS system. If there is no source of lighting indication, then these might be battery operated, and so checking would be simple. If battery operated, first open the battery case cover, light a lighter/candle for a few seconds, and as soon as the buzzer goes on, remove one of the batteries. That should prove that the FAS works.

If it is building controlled, consult with the building owner first before taking any drastic steps..

Maybe these helps...good luck with your inspection tomorrow!</CBody>

		<CBody>i think you should have no problem, but the papers you will require are a bit troublesome....
anyways, with the new requirements here are the papers you will need for the approval (ive been through this proceedure just a month ago).

1- your passport copy with a copy of your RP.
2- your child/childrens passport copy with a copy of their RPs.
3- Marraige/divorce Certificate.
4- Salary Certificate from your employer with date of employment. preferably certified from the housing department (but in that case you will need 2 copies of your salary certificate, as one copy stays with the housing dept)
5- Bank Account Statement from your bank, preferably stamped from the bank.

then you must type out the application form (you can type it out at the immigration office) identifying which nationality you will be employing. 
then you go to building no. 4 to apply the application with the attached papers required.
they give you a follow up slip that has the visa request number on it. you can track the application online at www.moi.gov.qa 
if its approved then "Mabrook!" otherwise you have to go upstairs and talk to the manager and he should "approve" it for you after you tell him why you need the helper!

good luck! need any help let me know!</CBody>

		<CBody>Do you think you are superior to North Africans? As I said there are local women who teach Arabic. 

And there are alternatives to people from the magreb teaching Arabic. Look at all the people here from Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt (although I wouldn't study Egyptian Arabic because every other Arab laughs at you).

		<CBody>for ur information north africans are tunisian and moroccan and if u claim that  it is up to them ti teach arabic then u assert that they are arabs or how could they teach a language they do not speak! allow me to say that u r speaking out of ignorance! it is true we are not 100% pure arabs but the islamic openenigs were centuries ago!
we speak better arabic than u and better french than u and better english than u despite the fact that we dont use it on a daily basics!

		<CSubject>Baya, you don't use English on a daily "basics"?</CSubject>
		<CBody>I rest my case. This is not a case of "text speak"; it is a case of fluency and your post doesn't reflect solid knowledge of English grammar and vocabulary . Also, I have heard Moroccans, Algerians and Tunisians speak English, even ones that earned a university degree in English, and their pronunciation is never that of a native speaker. A good friend of mine has a Moroccan wife who has a PhD in English from one of their major universities and although her grammar and vocabulary was great, she couldn't really tutor because students wanted someone who had a native accent and 99 times out of a hundred, that will not be someone who studied English in a foreign university. 

Sorry, but my wife was an English teacher for many years and still tutors, and I am still surprised at what passes for "teaching" in many cases. </CBody>

		<CSubject>Bikes Rental</CSubject>
		<CBody>Hi Robby,

I've been trying to do a come back after abandoning the sport for 25 years, I only got hooked up again when my kids grew up and started to create the adventure in me again (as usual they started with the quads) I've been looking for a used bike that is in the 250cc range, not less than 2 cylinders, weighing 400 Lb or less, and seat hight of not more 31" (I'll feel more confident when both feet flat on the ground), you've guessed it right Kawasaki Ninja 250R is best fit.

I had no luck at all finding such bike not even the dealership have them in stock until end of the year, but I wanted to practice during the remainder of the season.

Any advice is highly appreciated.

BTW: I've just started a thread on your web site (www.q-biker.com) hope to see it growing.

Off course, you will enjoy a very good rate, if you rent a motorcycle long term. That is the same, as if you rent a car.

You may as well drop by in the shop and speak with my sales guy. The location, opening times, phone numbers, etc. are all posted at the web site.

		<CSubject>RE: US Educational Group</CSubject>
		<CBody>Wow, you are looking at VERY different schools. The University of Kentucky is a large (huge) state school offering almost all possible course of study and where the students will be mostly from Kentucky. Roger Williams is a small, elite liberal arts school in Rhode Island. If you like Virginia Commonwealth, your best bet is to stay in Doha rather than going all the way to Richmond, Virginia. There are thousands and thousands of school in the US, you may want to narrow them down by size, majors offered and geographical area. Not to mention admissions criteria! By the way, you are getting late for admissions for next fall.</CBody>

you are right regarding the tuition fees, all exceeded 25000 $ , but they have scholarships at to 12000$ and a student ccan work up to 20 hrs per week and so on...
so we'll c ...i think im gonna go for that by 2010

Instead of increasing the cost of the mobile by sending skycom or DHL or ARAMEX or any courier company. Since all the mobile brands are available in INDIA, send the money there, let them purchase it from there.

	<Comment CID="Q2936_C1" CUSERID="U37" CGOLD="?">
		<CSubject>RE: Finger Print Location</CSubject>
		<CBody>Keep on Salwa road. (this is the main road that radiates out of Doha from the Ramada signal and takes you to the Saudi Border). So, keep on Salwa Road and you will cross Midmac round-about (now a flyover) Decoration round-about, Wholesale Market round-about, Aziziya round-about and another small round-about before coming to the new flyover which has replaced Industrial Area round-about. Go straight over the Industrial Area flyover, and keep to the right lane. About 500 mts after the flyover, and just before the next interchange, there is a road to the right, perpendicular to the main road. Take this right turn and on your right hand side is the new CEID department building where you can have your finger prints taken. I got it done for my family in less than 15 minutes.</CBody>

They range from cripples to marathon runners.

	<QBody>How is the weather like in Qatar?

The weather is generally pleasant in winter and hot and humid during the summer months. Winter daytime temperatures average a very pleasant 20-35 degrees Celsius (68-95 degrees Fahrenheit), although nights can be relatively cool. You will need to wear a sweater or a light coat during the winter. In summer, the temperature gets as high as 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit).

Just after your arrival, as a parent you should visit both schools yourself.
You should check the school's curriculum; activities plan and the academic calendar...ask for the strength of the particular class and see the premises...
If youre satisfied by all means, then decide yourself where to enroll your child.

		<CSubject>Voltaire or Bonaparte?</CSubject>
		<CBody>Bonaparte is probably much more famous than Voltaire. Apart from "Candide", no one bothers with Voltaire's literary works any more. Yes, he was a leading force in the Enlightenment and he has had some influence on French thought, but Napoleon's influence upon the whole of Europe was far more profound. I suppose that you could compare Napoleon to Hitler, as in some ways Napoleon was responsible for a series of wars that affected the whole of Europe, from the gates of Moscow to Madrid. On the other hand, Napoleon was not a racist and certainly never even contemplated genocide. To be fair to Napoleon, it is true to say that the old monarchies of Europe were very unhappy with the appearance of republican France and therefore they set out to squash the Revolution by force of arms. So Napoleon did not start the wars that dragged on until 1815, but he certainly continued them, very successfuly for a long while, and his final defeat also meant the end of the Revolution and the return of the Bourbons.</CBody>

		<CSubject>Both are good schools</CSubject>
		<CBody>Both are good schools but
Bonaparte will teach your kids to become a good leader but they concentrate mainly on outdoor physical activities, manoeuvers &amp; strategies. Horse riding and lances &amp; swords are their speciality. They also concentrate on proper health hygiene &amp; sanitation and frequently remind the kid about properly using water in the loo..which the gauls generally dislike! 
So they will make a good manager &amp; strategist of you kid!

on the other hand Voltaire will make your child more of a philosopher! They encourage independent thinking...and mainly concentrates on indoor activities! They inculcate good moral values in the child and he will surely grow up to be a thinking person! In school they encourage kids to read great works of science and fiction. The literary skills in your kid will bloom. In addition they also teach the art of candid photography &amp; journalism!
Specialization: Wit &amp; sattire in poetry &amp; Prose!</CBody>

		<CBody>You or your husband must have a Family status visa and earn more than QR4500. If either of you earn at least Qr4500 per month you can ask your employer to change your visa to a Family visa. Then you can bring your daughter in and do the requirements.

Without the minimum salary of one person, they wont normally change your visa status (unless you know someone, who knows someone)</CBody>

3- Bank statement of salary for at least 6 months

		<CBody>slandering a school can be serious especially if it is not true and for your information the owner of that school building is working from the government at Qatar University. so Pike is in serious trouble there. but individually cases like living with someone who is not their spouse is not a big deal for them as too many of these case here. I'll give you an example.
One of my neightbor send her maid to jail when the maid stole some of her jewelries and some money and run off with a local guy. the maid was sent to jail for 1 year for stealing and not for running away with the guy who helped her. The lawyer told the maid's sponsor it is the maids business if she wants to practise her sexual activities with other man although the maid is married back home.</CBody>

And dont think that I advise to violate the law. Again, you definitely cannot live together while both are working here, you cannot be common-in-law here. But visiting definitely everyone can come and visit his/her friends here, nothing wrong with that

His profile says that he is a pilot. IF (an assumption) he is working for QR and living in their housing and his girlfriend sashays in and out every couple of months I suspect that he will be busted sooner than later. QR is pretty strict. He will have to decide if it's worth losing his job and being deported for violating company policy as well as Qatar law. Can he get away with it? Yes, probably for a while. Will he? I suspect not and the consequences are severe. It's not just a slap on the wrist.

jamon - I think it is illegal for an un-married man and woman to live in the same house, even if they aren't girlfriend and boyfriend, so not telling people she is your girlfriend will make no difference.

also jamon - I find it odd your encouraging someone to break the law while in another thread you are mentioning that CID watch the site and will trace IPs and act on things if they're reported.</CBody>

OTC (over the counter) medicines for colds, fever or flu just in case. The weather here is kinda getting colder and a change in the weather, your friend might catch a cold or flue...almost all newcomers here experience it

Antibiotics like Penicillin, amoxicillin coz here in Qatar, you need to have a prescription to but antibiotics

It gets packed later at night but the DJ doesn't play any latin music. The DJ starts around 11pm I think, so before that it's good.

	<QSubject>Where is Palm Gardens 1 compound?</QSubject>
	<QBody>Hi all,

There is a villa there I would like to check out but since its the weekend and Ramadan I can't get hold of the agents. All I know is that it is in the abu hamour area but that's a pretty big area. It is not palm gardens 2 which is near the rugby club. Anyone have any idea? Thanks! </QBody>

		<CBody>Thanks for the help guys. I drove all over the Al Waab area and did see the palm city gardens compound but that's not it. This compound is run by BetterHomes and according to their listing on their website this compound is in Abu Hamour. So I went driving all over that area to no avail as well.  I have tried contacting them a few times but nobody has bothered to get back to me. Maybe I should try again after Ramadan.</CBody>

		<CBody>just my 5 cent worth of opinion: not all the things you need, you should buy abroad just because they are more expensive in doha. i wouldnt buy a baby cot and brought it over to doha. likewise for diapers (pampers). how many packs of pampers can you buy from abroad for a good one year supply, just because they might be cheaper abroad. my opinion is you should consider buying things, which are not in Qatar, from your home country. even if you try to avoid paying more on baby stuff, you will eventually spend more on something else out here and at the same time paying less for other things too, like car and petrol. </CBody>

		<CBody>A baby born out of DOHA if travels within 90 days (from its country of birth to doha) from the date of his/her born, there is no need of any VISA for new born..
The only thing is that both the parents should have valid RP inorder to bring the NEW BORN without visa..A baby can get visa on arrival..
Make sure that your wife should bring BIRTH CERTIFICATE alongwith her..

		<CBody>what most people dont understand is that there are terms and condition for Credit shield 

these are some of them that I remember when i was in the bank
1. Regualar payments 
2. its takes 90 days to get approved in that time you still have to pay if you miss once it doesnt work.
3. Honestly being in the credit card section you will not believe the way you get ripped off. 
4. Your company has to be listed. 
5. termination not because of bad behavior or anything thats your Fault 
7. Credit shield is a pain in the ass. 

How i manage my credit card its unbelievable. 
I have not cancelled my credit shield but i have never paid for it too 
how do i do tht i make my payments before the bill is made as in i make the full payments.</CBody>

		<CBody>You can find maple syrup in MegaMart, but it's not cheap.  I don't know if it will be Grade A or Grade B, though. I *think* I've even seen small bottles at Carrefour. . .and ditto on the price.

Don't worry too much about the Grade A vs Grade B.  The grocery stores tend to sell Grade A because consumers associate "A" with being superior to "B".  The Grade B does have a slightly nicer flavor, but Grade A will work just fine in your recipes.

Like someone else mentioned, we bring ours in from the U.S. because it's much much less expensive. I think I brought at least three or four liters with me!

Enjoy :o)</CBody>

		<CBody>You said "processing" so it means you are not yet sponsored by your current employer.  You can resign but bear in mind that you have a limited time to stay here for a business visa or else you have to pay the penalty when your visa expires.  So if u will resign, make sure there is one position ready for you and willing to give sponsorship or even pay the penalty when your visa expires during processing.

Goodluck!!! </CBody>

		<CBody>You have to do the following actions before you go for medical and fingerprint processes if you want to change the job,
1. Resign from present job. 
2. Go back to your origin. 
3. Come back with new employer.
You cannot change job here itself, coz your sponsor is present employer.

		<CBody>If your employer has paid for your coming to Doha and your visa he will probably not look too kindly on your taking the opportunity to find another job. Transferring your employment means an NOC. If your sponsor hasn't processed your RP but has paid for everything it would be immoral to use this loophole to skip on him. These kinds of shenanigans are the reason for the strict laws in Qatar.</CBody>

		<CBody>The first issue here you enter in Qatar with Business Visa it is renewable up to 90 days. Second,the company who issued you a business visa it is your sponsor, if you working visa still on process with the same sponsor you are not allowed to look for new sponsor. Third, if you came here and use business visa as your entry document and your purpose is to look for other company, still you need NOC from your sponsor, I mean from the company who issued you a business visa.</CBody>

		<CBody>ayutthaya for me. but it's not a beach area so you can't scuba dive there. i love the temple ruins.

don't know about the beaches and the scuba sites though coz there are better beaches and dive sites in my own country imo.

try to stay at hostels so you can meet other travelers and get cheap travel tips from others. apart from the affordable accommodation of course.

you're gonna be staying for three weeks so it would be best to try all places in the country. or travel by land to neighboring countries in indochina like vietnam or cambodia. never been to these countries myself but i'm planning to when i go home for my vacation this year.

would've loved to try watching one of the 'shows' in patpong when i went to bangkok a couple of years ago but imy travel buddy back then was such a killjoy.</CBody>

Coral &amp; Raya island are the best in my view for diving as they have Fab reefs and are away from the hustle &amp; bustle...

If you want somewhere really remote then head to Ko Adang, this is where you find amazing jungle, waterfalls &amp; great nature....

Just be safe whereever you end up.. we were robbed of everythin in the first 10 days!! they packed up all our stuff and left us with NOTHING! however it was the best 3 months of Travelling that I did!</CBody>

1.Phone calls and Sms 
2.Camera
3.Internet/Email
4.Chatting

most of the smart phones can offer you all of the above, but my suggestion is dont go in for a smart phone if you are not going to use all of its features. </CBody>

		<CSubject>Smoke is correct.</CSubject>
		<CBody>Decide what you want to do with your phone. Does it / will do the basics well?

How much do you want to spend?
Do you want a true multi media device
Do you want email / internet on the go
Do you want good camera capability?

Smart phones these days are capable of doing so much, that many of the features just do not get used. For example, how many people use the voice management on their device?

I know the kind of things I want with my phone, so decide that first, then go shopping.</CBody>

		<CBody>yep Mozzie a good piece pf advise!  So b4 buying anything else,  always ask yourself first if you need it or just wanted it, you see the big difference.  It works for me.  Also don't go for brands names as they just almost the same as the ordinary but you will save a lot, unless it's further reduction.  

Goodluck!!!!  </CBody>

		<CSubject>basic tip...</CSubject>
		<CBody>am kinda new here in Qatar..but here's from my financial adviser Dr.Suze:  the basic tip to saving money, is simply to GET A GRIP, focus on where you are today:  what you have, what you owe..e.g., track your spending, calculate your net worth, check your credit profile, cut spending by 10%..in short, don't live beyond your means.

i understand how you feel..money is tight..you're busy..tackling money issues isn't fun..but you don't need all that stress..you can easily pull that off..make 2010 the year to find your financial confidence..take charge and good luck!</CBody>

		<CBody>suzan, thank Allah I'm not a coffee person at all. I enjoy my Rainbow and Lipton when I'm in the mood. As for SAVING, since that is your question. I think it is pretty simple. Start from the first day. When you get your salary, ex. Qr10,000, set aside Qr2,000 in a saving account that you would open. Make sure you make it a standing monthly order, so your brain will function to accept that your salary is only Qr8,000 and you would have to manage with that. Maybe you would want to start small, but 20% of your monthly pay is a great start. Then you can increase it when you manage to settle into the saving/budgeting lifestyle. 

Good luck!</CBody>

		<CSubject>My tips are:</CSubject>
		<CBody>&lt;i&gt;1:Avoid to purchase such items in advance which you think might be rarely used by you.
2: Try to compare product prices with similar products especially buying groceries/household items.
3: Avoid branded products maximum if possible e.g. Shirts,pants,trousers &amp; shoes which can be purchased with very less prices in Musheirib Street,Souq Najada or Souq Area.
4: Maximum avoid eating from outside.
5: Try your luck by investing your savings as much as you can in DOHA BANK ALDANA SCHEME, AHLI BANK'S MY HASSAN SAVING CERTIFICATES or NATIONAL BONDS-UAE. May be you might get lucky and win MILLION RIYALS.

		<CSubject>RE: Tourist Visa</CSubject>
		<CBody>Since you are holding an engineer's work permit, you will surely get the visa on arrival..Your passport should be valid for more than 6 months and RP of Qatar should be valid for more than 3 months(i hope i am right with this information)..If you are not sure still, check with the UAE embassy..it would be better...

Since your wife is on your sponsorship, she too will get the visa on arrival in UAE..

Has the visa charges increased now? I've heard the last charges were DH 105..Can someone please clarify me as well??? 
thanks a lot in advance.</CBody>

I would recommend to you the following links in which you will find several readings that are "a must" to anyone coming to Qatar "for the first time"

http://www.qatarliving.com/answers/cost-of-living/how-much-should-i-expect-to-save-in-20000-pm

http://www.qatarliving.com/qatar-guide

http://www.qatarliving.com/node/100993

http://www.qatarliving.com/node/171817

These readings will give you an idea (at least basic idea) of the City/Country.

	<QBody>Hi Everyone!

I am so happy to find this forum and looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

We will be moving to Doha this coming summer and are currently weighing our school options.  I am looking for more information on ACS International, International School of London, and Qatar Academy.  Any information at all about the environment, quality of academics, etc at these schools would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance!

What would you consider to be the best ranked schools in Doha?  Being from Canada we are looking for an American or IB curriculum to ease the transition when we return.  We will apply to ASD, but as you suggested, unlikely we will secure spots.  So we are left with ACS and ISL as I understand it.  Any others I am missing?

Thanks so much!!</CBody>

		<CBody>ACS is your best bet after ASD.  ASD and ACS are the only schools that truly follow an American curriculum.  it is new, but really has gotten off to a good start.  Parents are happy there.

QA is great but difficult to get in if you are not Qatari or work for QF.  Plus, the behavior of certain children who go there is rediculous.  Teachers afraid to discipline kids with a particular last name, so those kids run wild.

	<QBody>I had rented a car from a local company, they needed the car back for 1 day to get it registered. They gave me a loaner car to use and the loaner car broke down while I was driving it. The car rental company is saying its my fault and that I have to pay for a new engine on the loaner car. 

I refused to pay and the car rental place said it will send it to the police and the courts.

		<CSubject>RE: Do I need a lawyer?</CSubject>
		<CBody>Hello,

I would definately discuss  with a lawyer.

Did you sign a contract?  If so there should be a limitation on the amount you have to pay eg 1500 QAR in the event of a accident etc.

However, I wouldn't pay anything yet.  If you were driving the car normailly and were not in an accident that was your fault, then the problem is theres.  They provided a car that wasn't safe or suitable for normal driving.

Depending on what your lawyer says you could tell them you are going to call the police against them and see what they say.  They might back down (again speak to someone who knows if there are any ramifications for this!)

It may also be advantagous to have someone call on your behalf.  There are bound to be some lawyers in here who can give you some quick advice.

All the best, if you need anything please PM me.

Cheers

and then you ask the people to cite the article...would rather suggest to you to go back to the law and get it right.

Contact a lawyer for support and guidance or go to the Ministry of Labour for details.

		<CSubject>If his contract doesn't</CSubject>
		<CBody>If his contract doesn't state anything to the contrary, I believe at minimum he is entitled to 3 weeks salary for every year worked = in his case 25 years x 3 weeks = 75 weeks or about 1.5 years last salary (not an average or his original pay but his latest).

However, some employers do state they will pay more than the labour law stipulates.  He should check his contract.  His employer is NOT allowed to pay less than the minimum the labour law has approved. If in doubt or dispute, he should contact a reputable lawyer.  This is a substantial sum of money.

	<QBody>Hi,

I want some good soil for my plants.  I have both, indoor and outdoor plants.  I found shops like Family Food Center, selling big bags of what they say is mud, but I found it to be plain manure.  Mud or soil is brown in color, and what FFC sells is manure.  Anyone knows where in Qatar can I buy soil?

		<CBody>Belgium has some fantastic tourist locations that would take maximum 4 days to see if you were on a snail's pace.

Brussels is an awesome city to visit as well as live. I find it as cosmopolitan as Paris or London. Other great cities to visit are Brugge, Ghent and Antwerp. If you want a little seaside action you can head up to Knocke or Blankenberge.

From my experiences as a foreigner in Belgium have been that in the Flemish speaking (Not German, Paul) areas are a little less acceptant of differences in the way people look and will definately stare and ogle.

But in Brussels and its suburbs there is none of that what so ever... and none in the southern French speaking areas really from my experiences.

There are quite a few 'halal' restaurants in Brussels. Particularly between Gare de Midi and the Arab quarter of the city.

		<CBody>Belgium is nearer to France than UK.. Which is very good.

Famous for child sex cases.

They eat Frites.

They drink beer.

Following will hopefully summarise belgiuns..


 A Belgian came into a bar and ordered a beer. The waiter put a coaster and a beer on the table.

Ten minutes later the Belgian ordered another beer. The waiter brought him the beer and saw that the coaster had disappeared. So he fetched another one..

Ten minutes later, another beer. And again the coaster was missing. This time the waiter decided he would not lay down another coaster..

- "Hey" the Belgian said, "where's my cookie ?"

		<CSubject>correction, Belgium speaks Dutch, not German!</CSubject>
		<CBody>The official languages in Belgium are dutch (or Flamish to be accurate)and French. THere is a tiny area where people speak German, but this is not regarded as an official language associated with Belgium.

If you go to the tourist area's (Knokke, Brugge, gent etc) or the big cities like Liege, Antwerp or Brussels you'll be fine.

In the coutry-side or smaller villages people might make foreigners feel ''unwelcome''.

Overall Belgium is a lovely place to visit, great places of sight seeing and amazing food too.</CBody>

		<CBody>n 1830 the Belgians revolted and declared their independence. Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg was chosen king in 1831. The Dutch invaded later that year. After years of negotiation, an armistice was arranged. The Treaty of London, signed in 1839, established Belgium as an independent state, whose sovereignty and neutrality were guaranteed by all of the European powers.

When another staff from India went for the same procedure he was told to have the originals attested and was also told that this applied only to Indians.

You need to get your degree attested first from State Secretariat at Mumbai, as you have passed your B.Tech from Maharashtra.
Then, you will have to get it attested by any Regional Office of Ministry of External Affairs, located in some state capitals and in New Delhi.
Upon endorsement by Ministry of External Affairs, just go to Qatar Embassy in India, and get it ratified.

Now, your degree is perfect and you will not face any problem in Qatar for any further ratification from Indian Embassy in Qatar and Ministry of External Affairs of Qatar.</CBody>

Use the link below. The map cross-hairs are on the turn off from main road.

		<CSubject>RE: How to find a home for three kittens?</CSubject>
		<CBody>The responsibility of pet ownership does not cease when it becomes "inconvenient".  Why don't you take them with you?  All you need is the correct paperwork, a cat carrier or two and the willingness to try.

As for putting them on the street, better they should be euthanized rather than having them starve, get beat up by other cats, run over by a car, or tortured by some of the misguided children.

It's good you're trying to find them a new home, and perhaps your circumstances are such that you really can't take them with you.  But under no circumstances should you put them out to fend for themselves.  Good luck.</CBody>

I just bought my copy. The day after buying it, I lose my job so I'm leaving the country soon. The book is completely intact and unregistered. The only thing missing is the cellophane cover that it comes wrapped in.

If anyone wants to buy this completely unused 2009 edition for less than 195QR, then drop me a line soon, else I'll gift it to a friend.

		<CBody>hi, you can apply here. but some procedures you need to do.
1. you need to have marriage contract and birth cert. of child with red ribbon from DFA Phil.
2. then you need to go bring those documents at Phil. Embassy here in Doha for stamp.
3. then after that you need to go to Ministry of Foreign Affairs for stamp. 
4. Now ask your company to process Family Visit Visa for your wife and child. 

Hope it helps.

I am not sure about Phils, but here to apply you need their passport copies, copy of your marriage certificate, copy of your kid(s)' Birth certificate(s) -/sometimes these documents must be attested, not always though/- , NOC letter from your sponsor, bank statements. to be eligible to sponsor your family, you have to meet certain requirements (position, salary, etc.)

		<CBody>DeeDee, if a baby or child's immune system is not developed enough to be able to process the antibodies inside a vaccination then it is pointless and stupid.

Now if we are to discuss the meaning of this word vaccinate then what is being done is not vaccination as by definition a vaccination is to inoculate with a vaccine to produce immunity. 

It is proven that this is not being done. How is it that 20% of TB cases in Qatar had been 'vaccinated' and received boosters?

		<CBody>It depends on the school and the level of your education. 

Normally it starts from QR 2500/- up to QR 10000/- with respect the scools and subject.

But you can take tutions which will help you to sustain here.

		<CBody>well it all depends on the school you work, the grade you teach for and your qualification and experience. Please be specifice in all your quistions if some one has to help you. The suggestion of taking tution is really bad  most of the teachers in india seem to be so vague in class and that makes kids go for tution. The teachers must be ASHAMED  as they dont do their job sincerly though  the parents pay so much as school fee and you teachers  dont teach properly to gain students for tution. These teachers must be sacked </CBody>

	<QSubject>Who is an expat? </QSubject>
	<QBody>Hi All, I noticed that people selling their cars say that they are "expat" or "expat car".  Well, what does that mean?  Do "expat cars" bring more value than local folks' cars.  I know expat take care of their cars and spend money on it.  But, really .. who is an expat.  To me .. when I read the advert, I expect an native english speaker or europeans.  Is that so? or expat is just everyone who is not local?</QBody>

		<CBody>In its broadest sense, an expatriate is any person living in a different country from where he or she is a citizen. In common usage, the term is often used in the context of professionals sent abroad by their companies, as opposed to locally hired staff (who can also be foreigners). The differentiation found in common usage usually comes down to socio-economic factors, so skilled professionals working in another country are described as expatriates, whereas a manual labourer who has moved to another country to earn more money might be labelled an 'immigrant'.

When the Arab "expat" holds dual nationality, they point it out as a privilege. Who am I exactly in all of that, I have no clue.

		<CSubject>Expat are non locals .. yeah right .. </CSubject>
		<CBody>Expat are non locals.. Yeah right.. Not all of them.  To the locals, expats mean westerners.  Especially, white folks.  If you are an Arab with a westerner nationality, you are still called an arab with a westerner nationality.  That is true for Indians, Pakis,...etc.
I think historically, the British expats who were here in the early days (70s, 80s) were a true representation of expats.  However, this has changed a lot through our the years.  I think the term "expats" now apply to a wider group of people.
Anyway, all expats are welcome as they as they understand the culture.
One sad thing though, is the separation between expats and locals.  There is a boundary and low engagement.  That is why those terms will still have a meaning.  I am really looking for that day, when this term "the way it means today" disappears!

I haven't been here long enough, but I don't regret anything about moving here. Before coming here I looked up and read a lot about Qatar and the social scene(QL was a big part of getting info).
Even when you come here, take your time when deciding where you want to stay. Get a feel of the place and neighborhood. Move around in places you might enjoy (malls, Souq, Katara, go to the orchestra etc), and choose which hangout you like best enough to be frequent in. 

Is there any particular thing you are concerned about during this move?

All the best.</CBody>

Also, set up any savings accounts, ISAs etc you think you may need as once you're out here you'll be unable to set stuff up as an expat. 
On top of that, if you have a shipping allowance bring as much as you can - particularly boks, CDs, DVDs etc. I brought just a couple of boxes and have since had to buy stuff which I had left in storage at home.

		<CBody>If you will have difficulties further in looking for someone to do the job for you, then, you will be left with a compelling reason to just buy the entire part, and let sevice center(alfardan) install it. Although, this is gonna expensively cost you.

You can call 6064785.</CBody>

		<CSubject>RE: Housing Facility in Qatar Foundation</CSubject>
		<CBody>Their Housing/other facilities are very good...but if the job is in IT, you have to be cautious before taking the offer.  They recently (8 months back)outsourced their IT to EDS, so there are very less 'direct hires' to QF in IT.  Even if you get hired, there is no gaurantee that you will have a job as they are very keen on Outsourcing and other important factor is the Qatarisation.

Please check with the HR/Hiring Managers on these anc make sure you have a clear understanding of the road ahead before jumping in.</CBody>

http://www.dog-beds-n-beyond.com/coolaroodogbed.html is a website with a description and picture if you're interested.  Shop around, prices do vary.  I have also bought frontline and preventic collars to help prevent tick infestations on line.

		<CBody>As a continuation of my previous post, you can find somethings here, the prices can be more expensive (or less so when you take into consideration shipping etc.)  However, the bed is something I've never seen here.  I like it because it keeps the dog off the floor, easy on the joints - my dog is older, and cooler as the air circulates around it.  It is also easy to clean/wash and dries quickly.</CBody>

		<CBody>If you convert 45k to US dollars and you earn almost the same amount, then you better stay in the US. If not, don't hesitate, move to Qatar.  I have nothing against Qatar because the locals are now very adaptable people especially if you work in a well sought company. In fact you might probably feel that other arabs are more up to themselves. The way people drive there is crazy though. No discipline and road rage is massive! I had lived in Qatar for x amount of years so I know what it's like.  I will come back definitely...my passive lifestyle suits me to be there. good luck!</CBody>

Comingtoqatar - you can do a search on QL for your concerns and then ask specific questions if you still haven't found what you want to know and you might get some answers. 

Btw, we're all volunteers, not people connected with the govt tourism or anything so pls don't be discouraged if you don't get proper answers sometimes. I say this cos there have been many times in the past where newbies ask questions and expect answers and get upset when there aren't any useful ones and then blame the QL site owners. </CBody>

		<CSubject>RE: Parking Ticket</CSubject>
		<CBody>Number 1. It must be by credit card.

Number 2. If there are no points associated with the ticket then you can pay on line.

Number 3. If there are points then you must go to one of the police stations... Al Rayyan, Madinat Khalifa, Airport Traffic on Tadmur and E Ring or one of the kiosks at the airport and I think some of the malls.

good luck

On #3 that may only be for cars that the sponsors own, if it is your personal vehicle and your Qatar license is is tied to the vehicle then you may be able to pay on line. But company cars cannot because they don't know whom to assign the points to.</CBody>

		<CSubject>RE: Parking Ticket</CSubject>
		<CBody>Parking tickets usually have points (don't ask me why, they just do).  So you likely need pay in person.  Since you got it near City Center, easiest would be the MoI kiosk on the ground floor of CC, just under Carrefour.  Bring your credit or debit card (no cash) and your Drivers License.</CBody>

		<CBody>Please note, that an International Driving License is NOT a license - it is a translation of the license you currently hold - therefore it is not valid unless you also have your usual license. An international license is issued to simplify things for the licensing authorities in the country you are going to wish to drive in - all it does here in Qatar is speed up the conversion process. 

The 7 day rule applies to certain nationalities that are permitted to drive here without having to retake their test - providing they enter with a tourist visa - an international license will not help you in this instance,  you must always show your original license - if anyone has found this to be different then I will be surprised. 

And for those nationalities where a re-test is required here, an IL will not help - I believe you just have to grin and bear it and re-take the test again. </CBody>

		<CSubject>RE: Which is better Vodafone, Qtel or Virgin Mobile as...</CSubject>
		<CBody>There are a lot of choices in Qatar. Both postpaid and prepaid are available. Virgin Mobile is prepaid only.

If you are looking for the best network, you want to buy Shari (postpaid), Hala (prepaid) or Virgin Mobile. All of these give you the Qtel network, which has much better coverage.

If you are looking for the best experience (buying, customer care, support, ...) then go with Virgin Mobile.

If you are looking for the lowest price, postpaid is cheaper if you expect to use the number of minutes that come with the Qtel or Vodafone bundles.

If you also expect to use the phone overseas or to call overseas, then things get complicated, because there are so many promotions lately.</CBody>

		<CBody>Currently, Vodaphone and Virgin mobile are new and trying to capture market by their attractive rates. But in reality, their reception quality is very bad indeed because they are building their sites yet.

So in this situation, QTEL is best or if you want to avail their packages, buy any cheap mobile set and use their SIM on that phone for only out going.</CBody>

Once you arrive, you will be blood typed, tested, x-rayed and have your finger prints taken and then once you have passed all of that your sponsor will apply for the residents permit which is a passport size sheet stuck in the passport, which states your occupation and visa type.</CBody>

	<QSubject>Has Anyone heard about Europuppy?</QSubject>
	<QBody>Hi,

We were lookig for a dog/puppy for our family and that is when we came to see Europuppy in the internet. I would like to know if anyone in Qatar have tried to buy from Europuppy. Is it safe to purchase a pet online? What about the safety of the animal? The prices they have mentioned seem to be reasonable. Please do reply, if anyone have had a satisfied experience from Europuppy.</QBody>

		<CSubject>RE: Has Anyone heard about Europuppy?</CSubject>
		<CBody>Why don't you come down to QAWS and have a look at all the abandoned and homeless animals that need a home instead of buying one from another country. There are far too many dogs and puppies in Qatar that need a good home.

Please be advised that if you do get a dog online, you have to be careful as you might not get the dog you ask for, it may be sick and you have no idea of the temperment.

There isn't anywhere that can guarentee the reputation of Europuppy as it is an internet based shop. They do not breed the puppies but find them around Europe so you don't know how they've been kept and how the mothers are treated. You also won't be able to get a puppy under the age of 16 weeks as it is illegal to import a puppy younger then that into Qatar.

		<CBody>Chelsea, i am looking forward to go to QAWS this weekend with my family. I am just checking for an option incase I dont get a small breed. Because I had viewed the qaws site and dogs in doha site, all had medium to large dogs(I love big dogs, have two GSDs in my hometown but space prblms as discussed b4). I am not yet taking a decision, but checking out my options. I just want to know how trustworthy it can be, bcos the prices are too low which gives a doubt and just curious to know if someone from Qatar has actually tried it out.</CBody>

		<CBody>I always thought that europuppy is maybe a puppy mill because you only get to contact one guy and he'll get the dog for you and puppy mills dogs will only be sick and costing you more then what you paid for! and not to mention encouraging his business

you should adopt a dog from qaws they usually have small breed dogs every now and then and speaking of which! I just found a small breed dog couple of hours ago but I really needs to search for the owner before giving him away!!</CBody>

		<CBody>On-line long-distance pet offers are quite often scams. They will claim the puppy is a very low price or even free and then will charge you up-front for shipping and guess what -  no dog!</CBody>

		<CBody>Be very careful about buying animals unseen.  Far better to buy from a breeder known to a trusted friend who can see the animal for you. Puppies, especially those from puppy farms, are very stressed by transport and liable to succumb to various illnesses such as parvovirus if not fully and correctly vaccinated.

I do not know Europuppy but I have heard too many sad stories of sick and dying imported animals.  Check with the local vets and welfare people to see whether they can make any recommendations.  Also, do not forget that there are various conditions applied for the transport of animals by air and for import to Qatar.</CBody>

you go to medical angelus medical centre. show them your visa copy. pay the medical fees. get the result after 2 - 3 working days. get a NBI clearance.

your original passport
your original medical fit to work
NBI clearance for abroad
visa copy 
DHl fees 

Go to DHL any office the one that has wwwexpress blue sign. give them all the above documents + the fees. it will take 3 days you can tract it on their wed site. then you can go to POEA.

for sure,to get the present news call any DHL office and ask what it presently required for the kind of visa you are holding. </CBody>

		<CBody>I went step one international school it is close to me in al hilal area. They are so kind and they offer me an opening discount 25%. In fact my company will cover all my kids tuition fees and the registration fees but I am surprised when they told me that I should benefit from their discount and they will offer me the additional fees such as books, bus, uniform, activities and others. They wish to celebrate their opening with all the parents for the academic year 2010-2011. Really I appreciate their cooperative behavior with the parents.

		<CBody>yeah, it was a problem for me too, until last summer when i went back home for vacation. I brought from there some stuff  for my kitty, all for $1 :) I would love to share it with you, but some of them were given away right upon my arrival back in Doha, some of them got lost, some of them are not in a good condition. Currently my Cookie is playing with the Christmas tree balls, and she is sooo happy with them! She has emptied half of my Christmas tree (helped me to unload it for packing till the next Christmas), all the bottom of the tree is balls-free.. you can find balls everywhere: in the kitchen, under the bed, behind the couches, in my shoes.. she loves rolling them all over..</CBody>

		<CBody>Please DO NOT leave your kitten alone with any toys that have string on them and never give them toys that are small enough to fit in their mouths.

The best cheap toys for kittens are:

Ping Pong Balls (QR15 for 30 at Carrefour)
Empty Toilet Roll Tubes
Balls of Tin Foil
Childrens Wind Up Toys (they love to chase them!!)
Laser Beeem (bee shaped laser pen cat toy QR30 from ShopRite)
Socks

		<CBody>sorry... but if you are asking for a private ambulance... to compare with.... 

only one ambulance will come to you incase of any trouble. only hamad hosp ambulance, they have a complete equipment to take of you.
... there is also qatar red crescent. who works not for 24/7 duty. but they will be available in some events.... like sports event.... and of course they are visible in sealine resort every weekend. 
... some other clinic or hospital has a ambulance but they don't cater a call from 999. if i'm not mistaken... only for a private calls.

Web posted at: 2/27/2009 3:38:52

By MOBIN PANDIT and MOHAMMED SALEM 

DOHA: Qatar yesterday issued a new sponsorship law that retains salient features of the previous legislation, which was enforced some 45 years ago. 

...........

The new law (No. 4 of 2009) regulating the entry, exit, residence and sponsorship of foreigners was ratified by the Heir Apparent H H Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and will be enforced with immediate effect. 

Qatari women married to foreigners will be allowed to sponsor their husbands and children.

		<CBody>Non-muslim men  cannot marry a Muslim lady i believe
you will have to convert and face a tremendous amount of difficulty, this is not a normal event in Qatar. Other questions can arise about children, that's why u get married, in the past they could not automatically be Qatari! either way Qatar is changing, the fact that you can meet a Qatari lady and get to this stage in your relationship could not have happened in the past without male relatives deciding to avenge such an insult!

		<CBody>I bought some labels at the bookstore near the Burger King R/A but not the Avery's one. It was my first time there and they have few selection of things, I was kind of in a rush when I went there but will try to come back again and see what exactly they have. </CBody>

		<CBody>The selection is actually pretty good.  I was looking at the labels that are 10 to a sheet - large enough for decent nametags.  I can't remember what the per-sheet price was, but the entire box (1000 labels total) was either 45QR or 55QR.  

Assuming I have all the numbers right - and assuming that they work in a printer as well as the name-brand labels, that makes them significantly less expensive than even the Office Max brand labels in the U.S.  I think I'll give them a try!</CBody>

		<CBody>I haven't seen any Avery labels. . .and I've definitely looked.  Hopefully someone will have a better answer for you.  

There is a bookstore near the Burger King R/A - the one that sells toys, dates, computers, office supplies along with a pathetic book selection - where you can find labels of different sizes that are sold by the sheet.  It could be worth a look, but don't expect to find a huge selection.

	<QBody>do you find it tacky or practical to recycle unused,unopened gifts and give them to other people?i would really love to know your opinions about this matter.

		<CSubject>I am a proud regifter!!</CSubject>
		<CBody>You just have to be savvy enough to not regift the thing to the person who gave it to you initially.  Sounds easy enough, but when you've been stashing things in your closet for 12 months, you kind of forget where and who they came from!

My theory is that it's better those gifts go to someone else who might actually use and appreciate them than to sit unused in my spare bedroom for months on end.

And my friends and I usually have a Chinese gift exchange around the holidays, and that's an absolutely perfect opportunity for everyone to get rid of those types of items.  And some folks walk away really loving the new item they picked up!

		<CSubject>RE: Is it a good idea to put a KN Filter on my new...</CSubject>
		<CBody>Bro, I agree with cdpascual initial performance gainer would be Intake/Header/Exhaust modifications. If you modifed the Intake plate filter (K&amp;N) then you have to modify your header (use S/S Mandrel bend headers) and an aftermarket exhaust chambered/free-flow muffler ( ex.Tanabe G-Medallion) plus a layer of thermal wrap to ever notice performance. If you can afford a Cold Air Intake that would be better, with all this modifications this would surely void your warranty.

My point is that my passport expires in September. I need to travel in March, which leaves exactly 6 months validity on my passport. I don't think it will be a problem entering the country I entend to visit but I was wondering if it will cause a problem when I return to doha with less than 6 months on the passport (even though i have a valid work visa). If I renew now, I won't be able to travel in March as the renewal process takes about a month. I wish I could postpone but I can't.</CBody>

		<CBody>Yes, you can order. But, if you want your item to arrive fast here in Qatar, try ARAMEX's SHOP &amp; SHIP service.

		<CBody>You can get Mahindra Scorpio form Doha motors and trading company. This company is at Al Matar street just adjacent to Air port and before parachute roundabout.
I know in India, it is very good and famous vehicle. I too like it. But here in Doha, I have seen only 3 to 4 scorpio vehicles. I know that it is a good vehicle but also please think about resale value. Here maximum people are not aware of mahindra and TATA vehicles. TATA Heavy vehicles only I have seen. Therefore you can not expect more money while selling the vehicle.

		<CSubject>RE: Can you help....</CSubject>
		<CBody>If your child's front teeths came out and you want to fix braces to become the teeths in level, I think no dentist will prefer to fix it. Because your child is growing now and the shape of the face is not yet completed.So it is not good to fix braces in this gowing time.

It is very cosly here to fix braces. If your company provided insurance and the insurance company will cover this type of treatment then Okay. If you doing it in India, you have consult the dentist 2 to 3 times to tight the braces.

Anyway contact a good physician and ask advise.

It is even normal to tailgate, use mobile phones at a NORMAL 100 KPH when the NORMAL posted LIMIT is 80.  Thus NORMALLY everyone seems to accept that it is NORMAL to ADD + 20 or more to the posted LIMIT; or drive half the speed limit when about 20 vehicles tailing with no one else in front .

		<CBody>Once your fiance has the RP, he will have to wait for another 6months before applying for a spouse visa [ family visa]. 
Also his salary should be well with in the slab of 10000 QR for this.You cannot apply RP for yourself.

So a lot of major supermarkets will pick up a piece of gum or chocolate and scan it, so that it adds to the bill and rounds it up to an even number.  

Therefore the gum isn't change, but another item of your shopping.

I always just pay with a card these days, that way you only pay for what you want, and not a dirham more.</CBody>

What about sending them by courier to Qatar with prescription? Is it allowed?

Thank you,

		<CBody>They are not opening each and evey bag at the Airport. They will open only those bags which is suspicious of having something illegal. You can bring your medicines with the proof of purchase and the prescription from your doctor. There are many patients bringing their medicine for diabetes and blood pressure in hundreds.</CBody>

		<CBody>As far as our experience goes, there is no problem as long as you have your prescription.  We have been here 4 1/2 yrs and have never been stopped and questioned at the airport.  You can send it by courier with the prescription but it goes to "Customs" for clearance. I don't see any problem with you carrying these meds.

Best regards

		<CSubject>If you send it by courier,</CSubject>
		<CBody>If you send it by courier, they may open and check and then put a 'customs checked' seal / tape on the package, since it's medicines. 

If you bring it with you, they may check, depends on the type of medication, but if u have a prescription with you, it shouldn't be a problem. 

Like others have stated here, many bring painkillers, diabetes, n hypertension drugs with them here. </CBody>

		<CBody>If u bring it along with you, there wont be any problem, keep prescription and bill with you. But if u send it by courier then after customs checking it will go to HMC (White fort building) , then you have to go there with prescription and receipt and need to convince the Doctor in charge to collect the medicines.

Only ADNOC fuel stations in Abu Dhabi accept credit cards, you may not have to refuel your car if you have double fuel tanks. My Nissan Petrol dose 650km with two tanks and I had to refuel at Dubai - Abu Dhabi border only. Petrol in Abu Dhabi is QR4.25\Gallon in Dubai QR6.25\Gallon.</CBody>

Before I came, I was told that winter herr will be fairly cold and we will need to get at least fan heater for the bedroom. Now it's almost Christmas (in fact today is the winter solstice in norther hemisphere) and for me this is actualy very nice hence no need for the heater yet.

So, is this normal for this time of the year ? will it get much colder ? Does it augur a long and hot summer ahead ?

Welcome to Doha. i will not ask you to get ur passport, Ticket and Visa ... :-)
Well though you will get everything here, I would suggest you do get some warm clothing as it is winter season here (not so very cold though). Also get some food to last u for a day till u get to know the place around. that's all ...

January would still be a very cold month then i suggest you've got to bring a jacket with you. It maybe up to 6 degree celsius.. but im not sure i am not from the weather center.. hehehe well anyways, goodluck and welcome to doha!</CBody>

		<CBody>Welcome to Doha.........
I hope that you have a wounderful time after coming to Doha. Its very cold over here at present and so I request you to carry some good quality warm clothes. As you mentioned that the company is providing eveything thing then I think you dont need to carry anything much. Above all you are already a member of QL so any problem in future there are many to people to advice you. 
All the best. </CBody>

		<CBody>QR26,000 per month is the salary.

Housing of QR26,000 per month is a receipted expense, I.E. if the villa costs QR26K they pay QR26K, if it costs QR10K they pay QR10K therefore it's not worth taking anywhere cheaper.

Will 2.5K per month be enough to lease a decent car?</CBody>

		<CSubject>It depends upon the mood of</CSubject>
		<CBody>It depends upon the mood of the person. I think it would be more appropriate to know from where this abaya came or its origin so that one can come to conclusion. Abaya, the black thobe, is not an Islamic order or must. The only cover Islam requires women to have is to wear something which covers the whole body from head to toe &amp; the only thing should be visible is face, hands &amp; feet. Second thing is the dress should not be revealing or body fitting, it should be something decent which should not give a hint about their figure nor it should be too loose which might attract others attention to make u a fun object. Third thing that should be taken care about is the dress should have modest colours &amp; not shining &amp; lots of art work which would attract opposite gender. 

Now coming to abaya, no where in Islam it is mentioned, neither is Quran nor in Ahadees (Sayings of Holy Prophet PBUH). Abaya is something cultural, sometimes ladies are made to wear these so that they are not identified by hiding their faces too with Nakaabs (face veils). Majority of men make their women use face veils because they are in a culture where people make fun of families for not following cultural values, sometiems out of enimity if a woman of a certain family is identifiable they kidnap her or try to harass her only to degrade any particular family. Sometimes, it is simply the choice of woman who feels comfortable in wearing abaya only because if she comes out in normal islamic dress, she'll have several stares from other women, forget about men at this stage. So instead of answering everyone why she is not following cultural values / dresses she prefers to make their mouth shut by being one of them. Sometimes its too humid outside &amp; if the lady wants to follow her islamic dressing too she might wear something short inside &amp; on it she can wear a loose abaya, thus giving her comfort + no sense of guilt. So there  are several possibilities that come with abaya thing. 

My own thinking is that abaya is a full dress, its something like a man wearing shalwar kameez, or a woman wearing skirt shirt or an arabic man wearing white thobe so there is no need to wear additional dress to it. Briefs or vests are okay to make urself comfortable but wearing a skirt shirt then wearing a abaya for a corniche walk that goes beyond my mind. But yes, if you are working in a woman only environment &amp; as humans like to show off what new dress or shoes do they have, they remove their abayas in there &amp; move along with whatever decent they are wearing. 

Looks like I have written something boring so better to finish it off here :)

Cheers :)

		<CBody>i have a samsung, it's been almost 3 years.. didn't get any problem at all. no problem in connecting to TV, DVD, Blue-Ray and computers.

sony one start developing a blue blob( spot) on the screen that after some time eat up the entire screen and the entire screen become blue. thats common problem with sony.

i guess LG and Samsung having the same features.</CBody>

		<CBody>Dear fireheartin,

2 days back we bought Samsung 5 series 40" TV from lulu. Not yet connected with dish. so we use USB, Hard disk to see the movie. it is not showing the movie/video  option. Only showing the photos and music icon. so we are going 2 change the TV having all option like photos, video, and music. that's why i  raised the question.

		<CBody>Dear Selvi...

Samsung LCDS don't play the movies from USB port. Only the LED Tv that too series 7 and 8 only have the usb movie option.Recently we bought a SAMSUNG LED TV series 7 from lulu centre. It came around 8750 riyal in digital delights offer and we got a 32 inch LCD TV at free of cost... So i think if want usb movie option then u have to purchase a LED tv. Not a LCD....</CBody>

		<CBody>Learn Arabic through your friends, its the easiest and the cheapest way.
My offer as follow, we wrote a book of learning Arabic by using English letters. This book consists of 37 pages and it contains the following subjects:
Contents
Pronunciation of Arabic Alphabet
Pronouns - Professions
Landmarks in the City
Introduction
Colors
Numbers
Clock
Sports
At the Restaurant
At the Hospital
Appendix 
We tried in this book to mention the most common words and dialogs in Arabic.
The price of this book including delivery is 50 riyals (with out delivery 30 riyals).
You can get help from your Arabic friends at work to know how to pronounce the words
From my experience, learning Arabic is not easy and if you want to learn (read + write) you need 2 years at least to do that, so most people prefer to study the spoken course and learn the most famous words in Arabic, and you get that from our book.

I am planning for a road trip to dubai from doha next week. I saw in some posts that If I use the sand like spray, i have to polish the car to remove it.

		<CBody>I have used the sand like spray,... it does not need polish to be removed. It comes off just by water. And car paint is not effected. Not sure how safe the washing liquid is on the car paint. I think people use it because its cheaper than the sand spray.</CBody>

		<CBody>I don't know if anything can be done from here since the cancellation of your visa must be done at the Bahrain airport, not here in Doha. 

If your visa is expiring anytime soon, say within the next two to three months, I'm not sure either if your residence permit in Doha would be processed if your Bahrain visa has not been cancelled but has expired.

As for schools, Compass is right there in Al Gharafa and is the school that my 5yo son attends.  Sherbourne isn't too bad of a run from Al Gharafa (I don't think it is, anyway).

Like ominstructor said, getting into a school is going to be your biggest challenge.

		<CSubject>Worrying about a School Place</CSubject>
		<CBody>My old sparring partner Squarepeg is quite right, of course. A lot of schools in Doha have little or no provision for SEN children and there is not much in the way of EAL support either. Trying to get the students through a curriculum that is in their second language is no easy task, so of course many schools would prefer to have more students for whom English is their "mother tongue". 

If a school has a significant proportion of Qatari students, then of course the Supreme and Absolutely Perfect Education Council of Qatar will want to make sure that the little darlings are getting lots and lots of lessons in Arabic and Islamic Studies. (That's a fat lot of use if your family are not Muslims and and you speak English as your first language.) Learning Arabic may sound like a fun thing for your child to do, but it isn't because the Arabic teachers follow the Supreme and Immaculate Education Council's orders and therefore they teach it in a really dull and useless way, instead of concentrating on conversational Arabic that could be useful and enjoyable. As for Islamic Studies, the teachers (who are usually Egyptians or Lebanese) do not want to lose their jobs and so they let the students see the exam papers before the actual exams, so that they can memorise all of the answers. Then the students get amazingly high marks and everyone is happy.    </CBody>

As for Islamic and arabic studies, they arent mandatory at a lot of international school (only in some instances are arabic lessons mandatory but certainly not Quran).

		<CSubject>"Aren't mandatory"</CSubject>
		<CBody>Amoud has kindly suggested that Islamic Studies and Arabic are not mandatory at some schools in Qatar. He (or she) may well be right. The bad news, however, is that long waiting lists and lack of places ARE mandatory, it would appear, at all of the better schools in Doha. (These are usually the ones that do not have lots of Arabic and Islamic Studies on the curriculum.) Yes, a British passport does indeed come in handy, but so does a very big pile of cash. The better schools know that they are oversubscribed and so (surprise, surprise) they put up their fees accordingly.  

I have no problem at all with the idea of expat children learning Arabic. I do, however, get very annoyed with the way that the Completely Wonderful Education Council insists that expat children should be taught Arabic in a way that is totally boring, lifeless and insipid. When I was teaching in Doha, several expat parents told me that they were happy for their children to learn Arabic, but they wanted them to learn conversational Arabic that the children could actually use. When I quizzed the teachers, they said that the Utterly Amazing Education Council laid down the law about how Arabic should be taught, so it is just another example of the Totally Magnificent Education Council screwing things up.

Great to hear from you again, Squarepeg. I am now teaching at a school in the UAE, but I thought that it might be fun to have a look at Qatar Living, for old times' sake.  </CBody>

		<CBody>Hippo, what you are telling her has absolutely nothing to do with what she is asking, and to be honest a british passport does nothing for her if she is applying to a non-British school and then may not have much weight if the school does not have a policy of allowing entrance to it nationals first. 

Also, the huge pile of cash is baloney as well. If you have the money to pay the fees, or the company pays thats sufficient. 

The exams are also for the 2010 start, which she will have sufficient time for climbing the waiting list. It isn't as cynical as you make it seem, and I may add that the Qatar canadian school is governered by the Ministry of Education and offers neither arabic nor Quran at this point, but do offer french as it is the second language of Canada.

		<CSubject>Amoud, what you are telling...</CSubject>
		<CBody>Amoud, what you are suggesting to everyone (not just the original person who first posted the question) is that the school fees at most (or all) schools in Qatar are very reasonable. Or maybe you are saying that if the school fees are a bit high, then it is not a problem at all because your company will always pay. Many parents are not in this happy situation, Amoud, and sometimes there is a BIG gap between what your company is prepared to pay and what the school expects you to pay.

Your comment about "climbing the waiting list" assumes that you have in fact been given a place on the waiting list. If you bother to look back at previous postings on Qatar Living, you will find that plenty of parents have been told that the waiting list is full for the school of their choice, so how can they "climb" the waiting list?

Just in case you have not noticed, Amoud, again and again on this forum there have been postings about which schools in Doha are the best. Compass, DESS, Park House and Doha College have frequently been mentioned by parents as being some of the best schools in Doha. Guess what? They are all British schools and a British passport, though not compulsory, is highly desirable if you want your child to go to one of these schools. The American School also has rave reviews and (surprise, surprise) the fees are probably the highest in Doha. Hence my comment about piles of cash coming in handy.   </CBody>

The rest is nonesense as well. I have been here 10 plus years and my children have been given places in more than half of the schools you mention and we dont have British passports nor is our school funding coming from our company. 

People who complain about not having a spot in school are the ones who wait until the last minute to register. She is registering for September 2010. If I do recall it is now November 2009, more than 10 months in advance.....

		<CBody>"Please help. We are trying to move out to Doha from the UK this October, but are coming up against a brick wall with school places. Every school seems to be full with waiting lists. How on earth do you get your kids in to schools, especially those teaching Engliush curriculum. It seems to be impossible?" 

I just came across this new posting today, Amoud, and it does seem to suggest that getting a school place for your child is not as easy as you suggest. 

I am not an economist, but I do believe that there is something called, "The Law of Supply and Demand". If there is a shortage of something, the price goes up. This is what has happened (and continues to happen) in many schools in Doha, especially the British schools I have already mentioned.

		<CBody>Tourist Visa headache.
I went down to the building opposite the airport the other day to try and get a visa for the mrs. As i walked in I was surprised to find that there were only two people in there. When I went there in June the place was balls to the wall with bodies. Anyhow, I politely went up to the females who sit and process the visas, the freindly lady sent me over to the opposite desk to the not so friendly official who is suppost to stamp your form and check your documents. Now when i walked in the building this guy was obviously on the dog big time however, when I came walking over he was suddenly overcome with work and far too busy to be arsed with the likes of some expat who's looking to bring more expats in the country. So he looks at me with distain that would topple a camel and tells me the form that I've just 2 hours ago downloaded from the net is no longer valid and they've changed the rules. Obviously i should have known this information, he was somehow bemused that my world didn't revolve around the ever changing Qatar visa system and the fact that i didn't know the changes that had been implemented only last week he could not comprehend. He then bamboozled me with some number and name of a travel agent of the name he said so fast it sounded and i actually wrote down Quarabatra travel, it was only later after i repeated this to the woman at the end of the qtel directory enquiries that i found out he was actually saying Cleopatra Travel?? This company were even less helpful than the visa official. bottom line, if you want a visa you'll have to get one through the hotels but there is always a loop hole and being a Brit we always find em.. The hotel will get you a 30 day visa so if like me you want your tourist to stay at your place just get the hotel for a night. also that way the hotel gets to clean your bed sheets after you haven't seen the mrs for 2 months, its going to get sweaty.

Cheapest hotel i found was the Intercontinental QR1000 +19% bulls**t charge</CBody>

		<CBody>It may take 2 to 3 months for visa to be issued. No rent without visa. You can stay in a Hotel or of course company arranged accomodation.
Good Luck and welcome to Qatar. </CBody>

		<CBody>Better to check first your accomodation before travelling to Doha. If your accomodation allowance is included in your salary package then you will stay in the hotel on your arrival hence you cannot rent till you got the Residence Permit and this is required also for the application of your bank personal cheque to support the monthly rental.</CBody>

		<CBody>If your visa is cancelled by your sponsor,than I think you can not come. There is a restriction in computer in immigration........first check!
Or you can come back at the same (old) sponsor's visa.

	<QBody>Hello everybody

Please read my great experiance.

If you are purchase any items from the LULU CENTER you would not get any guarantee because they are not the responsible person and they will sent you to the real dealer. If you are going to the dealer they will not treat you as their own customer because you did not the purchase the goods from them. So take care in the future

I want to bring one of my friend under VISIT VISA who was my class mate in Philippine. But could you tell even though VISIT VISA  is only for 1 month, is there any possibility to EXTEND VISA at least for another one month. If anybody can help me in this regard, highly appreciate.

It's not the network...but the computer you are using has problem with the registry.

Just download CC cleaner then instal it...the run CLEANER..after that run REGISTRY...try to run your Yahoo.

If still same problem..you can use Tune-up Utility 2010.

		<CSubject>RE: health fitness center (gym)</CSubject>
		<CBody>I'd stay away from fitness first. It's a purely about making money, more so than any business.

While you are waiting inline for people to finish using equipment, you will see new people being given the tour of the place, when it is obviously over crowded already.

What's fitness first's answer? Come when it's not so crowded. HAHA. A Gym that wants YOU to work to THEIR timings.

Other than that, they have a lot of anti consumer policies, you cant cancel unless they take another month out of your credit card, they etll you you get a passport to use anywhere (but in reality you have to *apply* for it, and it's only for 30 days).

Just drop by &amp; see how they try to muscle you into taking the 1 year package no matter how much you tell them that you'll only be here for 6 months. Don't believe the transferable stuff because the responsibility is completely on you to find someone to transfer it to.

Also, parking in city center is hell. I could go on &amp; on &amp; on like how pretty much everyone there is paying a different rate for the exact same thing.

		<CBody>From your profile, I understand you are British.
I assume your family members coming here have British passports.

If this is true, then let them come and they will get the visit visas from the airport directly stamped onto their passports.
Each visa will cost 100 QR per passport and is valid for one month only.
REMEMBER TO TELL THEM TO BRING A VALID CREDIT CARD AS IT IS THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN PAY FOR THE VISAS IN THE AIRPORT!

If you wish to have them a resident permit (to stay here with you for more than that period) then you have to apply for  resident visas, which you can simply do after they arrive, if you wish.

Don't worry, they will have no problems at all in entering.</CBody>

Not everyone has a credit card! You can also renew the visa after one month for another month costing the same 100QR.

		<CBody>Dancing Queen,

If you say you did it without credit card, then this is new to me.

When I entered Qatar last year for the very first time, I offered cash and they refused any payment unless it was made by a credit card.

At the passport authorities, when I applied for my wife's visa, they also insisted on paying with a credit card. They even had machines that produced disposable credit cards for the value of the fee that were used once if the applicant did not own a credit card.</CBody>

		<CBody>The best investment is yellow or white gold because they are having a very good resale value. Diamond is not having a good resale value, every year its value decreases by some good percent. So better to buy gold and best shop is Damas which u can find at many places in Doha. Hope this can help u out :).</CBody>

		<CSubject>RE: diamond earrings or gold earrings???</CSubject>
		<CBody>Have you not heard the statements like " Diamonds are forever " and " A Diamond is a girls best friend " ?

Well diamonds are forever since, when you buy a diamond, you have to keep it forever , as its value reduces in an exponential manner and it makes no sense in selling it at 10 % of its price.

Secondly how do you know that the gold that you are buying is pure ? Back home they may just refuse to buy it back or ask for a 8 % discount on listed price.

Besides Gold will soon drop to about 800 $ per ounce in the comming months, so why buy at all ?

I sincerely feel that Silver has to do a lot of catching up so would buy Silver bricks if possible , I feel it will give better returns than Gold in the 10-12 month horizon !!

Cheers to you while you make the decision.

If you are buying as an ornament go for gold-- If you are buying as in investment -- go for Silver. </CBody>

		<CBody>For investment, both are OK if you invest like this.

Gold - Buy gold block from the famous shop with certificate.

Diamond - Buy loose good color (E), clarity (VVS1)and Carat (0.5 - 0.7) with certificate. Don't buy one carat diamond which is double price.

If you want to have good return, you have to invest quality one. Good luck in investment.</CBody>

	<QSubject>List some B grade audit firms in Qatar</QSubject>
	<QBody>I am a fresh graduate of MBA-Finance, just started ACCA last year.. I want to start internship with an audit firm. For this i want to know the names of some good audit firms except Big 4, with good client base. Because Big 4 audit firms normally dont entertain fresh graduates. This is the reason i am looking forward to join B grade audit firms. Please list some names.

Thanks</QBody>
